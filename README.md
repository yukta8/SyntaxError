Our team developed a website which allows the user to search for a topic and provides relevant resources from the internet in the form of youtube videos, articles and research papers.
This idea was inspired by our personal eperience as students as we often look for organised resources based on whether we want to study the topic at surface level or in depth.

In the future, we'd like to integrate ML models and better NLP algos to filter out data based on certain parameters.
In the discussion forum, we would like to allow the users to vote on comments, filter comments based on upvotes, report them if they violate community rights , edit/delete their previous comments, reply to a particular user in response to their comment, tag other users, etc. ;)
