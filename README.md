Our team developed a website which allows the user to search for a topic and provides relevant resources from the internet in te form of youtube videos, articles and research papers.
This idea was inspired by our personal eperience as students as we often look for organised resources based on whether we want to study the topic at surface level or in depth. 

<b>Tech Stack</b>: React,Node,MongoDB,Express

Key features: 
<ul>
  <li>
Allows user to search for a topic and displays data based on the depth of the topic</li>
<li>JWT authentication System + GoogleAuth</li>
<li>Discussion forum where users can share thein insights on topics of their choice. Other users'reviews can be viewed without logging in but a user cannot post a comment without logging in.</li>
</ul>

In the future, we'd like to integrate NLP(Natural Language Processing) to filter out data based on certai parameters.
In the discussion forum, we would like to allow he users to vote on comments, filter comments based on upvotes, report them if they violate community rights , edit/delete their previous comments, reply to a particular user in response to their comment, tag other users, etc.
