    Msg: "This series is so incredibly decadent to the point that it made me feel all the same feelings that I felt when I read the books. Its production is just an absolute marvel considering that it had been exclusively produced alongside the series' original writer and by that I mean, Jenny Han, herself. I think this is a great series to watch if you want to feel that nostalgic summer vibe and besides, who doesn't love to watch a series when it's got an aesthetically ambient summer house filled with such loveable characters who were written excellently. Also, did I mention how great the soundtrack is? It's got at least 5 Taylor Swift songs in it and I believe as a swiftie myself, I extremely enjoyed watching this to such extent that I didn't notice how long I was staring at my laptop 'till the scenes ended OBVIOUSLY TEAM JEREMIAH"
